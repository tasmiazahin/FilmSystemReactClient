# FilmSystemReactClient

## Create an React client application using Film Syetem REST api. Film Systen API will be your backend endpoints to use from where you can query/save from/to.

The goals of the project is to create a simple UI application using React. It is recommended to use Style-components for CSS.


### Functionalities

* List of all persons.
* Pagination
* Add a Person.
* List of all genre
* Add genre
* List all favourite movies for a person.
* Add favourite movie for a person.

Couple of backend endpoints is not covered in this applicatin. This application could be extended in many ways using all backend endoints.

I have used axios , react router and style components CSS to build the applicaiton.
